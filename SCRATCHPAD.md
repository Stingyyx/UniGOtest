## Tech Stack Requirements
1. Services (Free Tier Only)
   - Expo SDK 52.0.33
   - Supabase
   - Cloudinary (Media Storage)

2. Dependencies
   - React Native 0.76.7
   - React Native Paper
   - Expo Router 4.0.17
   - i18n-js 4.5.1

3. Development Guidelines
   - Use TypeScript for all new code
   - Follow Expo's file-based routing
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add documentation for new features
   - Test on both iOS and Android

## Error Prevention Plan
1. Dependencies Management
   - [ ] Audit dependencies for Expo SDK 52 compatibility
   - [ ] Remove unused dependencies
   - [ ] Lock versions to avoid breaking changes

2. Code Quality
   - [ ] Add strict TypeScript checks
   - [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
   - [ ] Add component documentation
   - [ ] Set up testing infrastructure

3. Performance
   - [ ] Implement code splitting
   - [ ] Optimize image loading
   - [ ] Add proper caching strategies

## Lessons Learned
1. Development Best Practices
   - Use base64 encoded alternatives for problematic static assets
   - Keep asset management centralized
   - Follow consistent file-based routing structure
   - Set up proper database relationships before querying
   - Use explicit foreign key constraints
   - Initialize i18next with proper configuration
   - Set tabBarLabel to null for group routes to prevent duplicates

2. Technical Solutions
   - SVG-based avatars provide better scaling
   - Use TypeScript for better type safety
   - Keep up with API deprecations
   - Add proper indexes for database performance
   - Use proper layout files for nested navigation

3. Database Schema Management
   - All schema changes must be added to @20240329_complete_schema.sql
   - Never create separate migration files for new changes
   - Include proper DROP statements before CREATE
   - Add appropriate indexes for new tables
   - Include RLS policies for new tables
   - Document all schema changes in comments
   - Test schema changes in isolation before committing
   - Maintain single source of truth for database schema
   - Include proper foreign key constraints
   - Add appropriate validation triggers
   - Follow consistent naming conventions
   - Schema file should be copy-paste ready for SQL editor
   - Include sample data when relevant
   - Add appropriate error handling in triggers
   - Document free tier limitations and constraints
   - NEVER remove existing schema in @20240329_complete_schema.sql
   - ONLY append new changes to @20240329_complete_schema.sql
   - Document all schema changes with [Cursor] prefix in comments
   - Add proper validation constraints for new columns
   - Include proper error messages in constraints
   - Test constraints with sample data before committing
   - Add appropriate indexes for new columns
   - Document any performance implications
   - Include proper cleanup triggers if needed
   - Add appropriate cascade rules for deletions
   - Document any migration steps needed
   - Test backward compatibility
   - Add proper error handling for constraints
   - Document any size limitations
   - Include proper character set specifications
   - Add appropriate default values
   - Document any timezone considerations
   - Test with maximum allowed data sizes
   - Add proper null/not null constraints
   - Document any unique constraints
   - Test constraint violations
   - Add proper foreign key indexes
   - Document any circular dependencies
   - Test with concurrent operations
   - Add proper error codes and messages
   - Document any locking considerations
   - Test with maximum connections
   - Add proper connection pool settings
   - Document any backup implications

   - Document any maintenance needs

## Regular Checks
1. Code Quality
   - Run TypeScript compiler checks
   - Verify no console errors
   - Test on both platforms
   - Review changed files

2. Performance
   - Monitor bundle size
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Verify translations
   - Test offline functionality

## Before Each Commit
1. Quality Assurance
   - Run TypeScript checks
   - Test on both platforms
   - Update documentation
   - Review changed files

2. Performance Impact
   - Check bundle size impact
   - Verify no breaking changes
   - Update changelog if needed

## Tools Usage
1. Python Environment
   - Use ./venv for Python tools
   - Include debugging info in output
   - Read files before editing

2. Git Workflow
   - Use "[Cursor] " prefix in commit messages
   - For multiline commits, use temporary file
   - Remove temporary files after use
